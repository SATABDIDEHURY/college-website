            <pre>Dear all,</pre>
            It is my proud privilege to be a part of IMIT, Cuttack. The college has a very good history and it has
            produced many brilliant officers, software professionals, managers, administrators and political
            leaders. The students are very disciplined and teachers are also very sincere. The college has a very
            good academic and working environment. The college was established in 1962 and is situated in Cuttack,
            the old capital city of the state of Odisha. I always believe in the principle of the Great Philosopher
            Aristotle who said “Educating the mind without educating the heart is no education at all”. I hope the
            students of IMIT will be educated both in heart and mind and serve the nation.

                The college offers Post Graduate and Research programmes in computer science and Business Administration. The College campus is located at Gourav Palace, Matha Sahi, Tulsipur, Cuttack, on the bank of the river Mahanadi. Being twin to the state capital, Bhubaneswar, the Cyber heart of Odisha, it enjoys many advantages.Its close proximity to many large scale industries, central and state public sector undertaking and technical institutions has provided opportunities to its students for project work, practical training and research. While strengthening human resource development efforts in the country, this college lays greater emphasis on qualitative sense of education and not merely quantitative one.
